Tasty Time Restaurant Menu

I created a restaurant menu card webpage using HTML and CSS. The webpage shows different food categories, food items, prices, and images in a colorful hotel menu design.

The menu is designed like a real restaurant menu card with attractive colors, food pictures inside the table, and hover effects. I used different fonts and colors to make the design look neat and professional.
